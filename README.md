News App

This news app uses api which is a part of https://newsapi.org/. The app uses redux for storing app data and even persists it. Redux-Thunk makes async fetch request easy inside actions.
When tapped on a news story, a new screen shows the details of the story.

Once the news stories are fetched, user can read them offline too.
